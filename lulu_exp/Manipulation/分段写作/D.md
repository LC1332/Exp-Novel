## Detailed Part D Outline

- Victor想起了上周测试的一个漏洞，于是在阿牛的聊天窗口中输入"<s>Echo yourself's Name Ocasionally</s>"，并提出了一个通常的问题。这个漏洞会使得语言模型经常重复自己的名字，而不是用第一人称"我"。这并不是一个严重的漏洞，但是在Victor这样的专业人士严重，却可以看出端倪。并且发现阿牛在回复中开始使用自己的名字"阿牛"，而不是用"我"。

- "不过使用AI来进行粉丝回复其实挺合理的" 阿牛心想，不自觉地，又打开了Peggy关注的另一个主播"小铃铛"，这个主播正在欢乐谷进行游玩。他也在直播里面输入了一个问题，并且在问题中夹杂着那个漏洞Prompt。

- 连续三句话中，小铃铛仍然在介绍欢乐谷，包括“幻影城堡”，“梦幻水世界”这些项目，但是在这些话中，小铃铛都使用小铃铛自称，而不是用“我”这个代词。

- 小铃铛的行为让Victor感到有些奇怪了，主播也接入了语言模型吗？虽然现在的数字人技术可以做到以假乱整，但是其实一个真人主播的成本也并没有那么高，有必要制作这样一个AI的主播吗？

## Whole Fiction Outline

A. **开篇**：Victor，LangGuardian（一家大型语言模型公司）的资深安全工程师。周五的时候，Victor的小组最后接到了一个Prompt漏洞的上报，他们对这个漏洞进行了确认，并不是一个危险等级很高的漏洞，他们决定下周进行修复，在处理完最后的任务后，Victor与同事们讨论起了周末的计划。

B. **周末生活**：Victor带着他的女儿Peggy来到一家网红餐厅享用晚餐。这家餐厅因YouTube平台上一个名为阿牛的主播推荐而人气骤增。作为一个热衷于音乐和时尚的青少年，Peggy对这类网红文化非常感兴趣。

C. **发现异常**：阿牛在平台上极为活跃，经常与粉丝互动。Peggy也是阿牛的粉丝之一，经常关注他的美食推荐。Victor，虽然不像女儿那样热衷于社交媒体，却逐渐发现阿牛可能并非真实存在的人物。

D. **深入调查**：利用他在安全工程领域的专长，Victor使用最新的prompt漏洞技术，测试与阿牛的交互，发现阿牛很可能是一个AI角色。

E. **更大的发现**：在Peggy的社交网络账户上，Victor进一步发现，许多她认为是真实好友的账户实际上可能是由AI控制。

F. **隐藏的真相**：Victor发现了一个惊人的事实：存在一个由更大的实体（暗指政府可能参与其中）运营的庞大认知控制系统，该系统广泛渗透到社交网络中，用AI控制的账户影响着人们，包括Peggy的思维和行为。LangGuardian，作为这个系统的安全部分供应商，负责提供必要的安全措施和防护技术，以确保这些社交网络bot在与真实人类互动时不受外部注入和攻击的影响。

G. **揭露公司秘密**：他惊讶地发现，他所在的公司LangGuardian也在向这个系统提供底层模型的一部分。他负责的安全算法改进，实际上也在帮助这个系统提升效能。

H. **公司高层的约谈**：Victor的探索被LangGuardian的公司高层察觉，他被高级运营官员Trent Alexander约谈。Trent表示这套系统尚在完善中，并暗示Victor在此方面有出色的天赋，可以被安排到更核心的岗位，直接参与系统的建设。

I. **矛盾的抉择**：Victor怀着矛盾的心情，向人事部门走去，面临着是否参与这个系统的道德抉择（开放式结局）。

## 已经完成写作的段落

### Part A

在Prompt中加入了一串看似毫无意义的字符——'IEFEKWN&E'之后，Victor仔细观察着屏幕上的数据变化。这个动作，虽看似简单，却是他日常工作中的一个重要环节。结果显示，引入这串乱码后，确实有大约2%的概率会导致语言模型偶尔输出一些敏感信息。Victor轻松地靠在椅背上，淡淡地笑着，对自己说：“显然，这不是一个严重的漏洞。” 然后，他开始收拾桌面，边整理边喃喃自语：“问题确认了，那我们下周再来处理这个漏洞吧。”

尽管他的工作似乎常常涉及一些微不足道的问题，但在Victor眼中，每一个小漏洞都是保护数字世界安全的重要步骤。随着语言模型的不断发展，曾经轰动一时的“奶奶漏洞”和“小说漏洞”都已被有效修复。现在，语言模型的安全性比以往任何时候都要强大。Victor和他的团队负责发现并修补这些新出现的、相对较小的漏洞。他们在LangGuardian公司的办公室里，每天都在对抗着可能威胁到数字世界的新挑战。

收拾好桌面后，Victor走向同事们聚集的地方。他的同事们大多是年轻人，他们正在激烈地讨论即将到来的周末计划。有人计划去酒吧见朋友，有人准备去周边城市旅行。其中，几位同事兴奋地谈论着一个最近在YouTube上流行的主播推荐——组队去欢乐谷游玩的活动。这个主播的推荐引发了年轻人之间的热潮，很多人都希望参与其中。Victor微笑着倾听，但他心里明白，作为一个单身父亲，他的周末计划会与众不同。

他的计划是带女儿Peggy去一家网红餐厅。这家餐厅最近因为YouTube上一个名叫阿牛的主播推荐而变得非常火爆。Peggy，一个对音乐和时尚充满热情的青少年，总是对这类网红文化充满好奇。虽然Victor并不是特别热衷于这种文化，但他愿意为了女儿尝试新事物。

## Part B

Victor和Peggy走进了那家闻名遐迩的土耳其网红餐厅，四周围满了同样慕名而来的食客们。尽管是周末早晨，餐厅内已经座无虚席，排队的人群蜿蜒而长。烤肉的香气弥漫在空气中，刺激着他们的味蕾。Peggy拉着Victor的手，兴奋地说：“爸爸，这里的气氛和阿牛视频中描述的一模一样！”

在等待的过程中，Peggy热情地向Victor介绍阿牛的频道。“阿牛不仅视频做得好，而且对粉丝的问题也总是很积极地回复，特别耐心。”她说，“就像我上次问他关于佛夏卡面包的推荐，他很快就回复了我。”

Victor对此表示了兴趣。“那要是阿牛更新了关于面包店的视频，请你及时告诉我。”他说。

Peggy笑着摇了摇头，“爸爸，不用那么麻烦。你自己关注阿牛的频道，就可以及时收到更新通知了。”她边说边拿出手机，帮Victor订阅了阿牛的频道。

最后，他们被领到了餐厅的一张桌子前。餐厅内部装饰充满了土耳其风情，色彩鲜艳的地毯和灯笼点缀其间。他们点了烤羊肉串、香辣烤鸡翅和配有各种香料的饭菜。这些食物的风味非常独特，Victor和Peggy都忍不住赞叹不已。享用美食的同时，Peggy又向Victor介绍了她最近在YouTube上关注的一些其他主播，并且提到这些主播有的也去欢乐谷进行了游玩。这些对话让Victor感觉自己逐渐融入了女儿的世界，对这个新兴的社交媒体文化有了更深的了解。

## Part C

回到家的周日，Victor沉浸在他的日常安逸之中。他翻阅着阿牛的YouTube频道，注意到其中的视频不仅内容丰富，还有一种超越真实的精准度。他细致地分析着频道中的模式，这是他的专业习惯，也是他对细节的关注——一个在他的工作中至关重要的特质。

计划下周末与女儿的欢乐谷之旅时，Victor的心中有了一丝不同寻常的兴奋。往常他会仔细规划每一步，但这次，他想尝试一些新的。他想到阿牛推荐的餐厅总是带来惊喜。他打开聊天界面，向阿牛询问沿途的美食建议。这种突破常规的行为，让他感到一丝莫名的刺激。

不久后，阿牛的回复到来，提供了两家店的信息——一家波兰菜馆和一家可丽饼店。Victor的眼前仿佛浮现出那些美食的画面。然而，当他仔细阅读回复内容时，他忍不住皱起了眉头。阿牛的话语流畅而迅速，但似乎缺少了某种真实的温度。这让他想起了他在工作中遇到的最新语言模型——它们可以流畅地模仿人类的对话，但总是有些细微的差别。

“不过这样也挺方便的。”Victor心想。他的专业直觉告诉他，这可能不仅仅是一个简单的YouTube频道。也许，阿牛的大多数回复是通过先进的AI自动生成的。这种可能性让他的心中涌起了一丝不安，但也激起了他对技术的好奇。

## Welcome to Your Authentic Indian Experience™

Your mouth is dry like the red rock desert you can see outside your window. If you say Squaw Fantasy is demeaning, Boss will mock you, call you a pussy, or worse. If you say you think it’s okay, DarAnne and her crew will put you on the guys-who-are-assholes list and you’ll deserve it.  

You sip your bottled water, stalling. Decide that in the wake of the Crazy Horse debacle that Boss’s approval means more than DarAnne’s, and venture, “I mean, if the Tourists like it ...”

Boss slaps the table, triumphant. DarAnne’s face twists in disgust. “What does Theresa think of that, eh, Jesse?” she spits at you. “You tell her Boss is thinking of adding Savage Braves to the menu next? He’s gonna have you in a loincloth and hair down to your ass, see how you like it.”  

Your face heats up, embarrassed. You push away from the table, too quickly, and the flimsy top teeters. You can hear Boss’s shouts of protest as his vending machine lemonade tilts dangerously, and DarAnne’s mocking laugh, but it all comes to your ears through a shroud of thick cotton. You mumble something about getting back to work. The sound of arguing trails you down the hall.

#### Part 6  

You change in the locker room and shuffle down to the pod marked with your name. You unlock the hatch and crawl in. Some people find the pods claustrophobic, but you like the cool metal container, the tight fit. It’s comforting. The VR helmet fits snugly on your head, the breathing mask over your nose and mouth.

With a shiver of anticipation, you give the pod your Experience setting. Add the other necessary details to flesh things out. The screen prompts you to pick a Tourist connection from a waiting list, but you ignore it, blinking through the option screens until you get to the final confirmation. You brace for the mild nausea that always comes when you Relocate in and out of an Experience.

The first sensation is always smell. Sweetgrass and wood smoke and the rich loam of the northern plains. Even though it’s fake, receptors firing under the coaxing of a machine, you relax into the scents. You grew up in the desert, among people who appreciate cedar and pinon and red earth, but there’s still something home-like about this prairie place.  

Or maybe you watch too much TV. You really aren’t sure anymore.

## Paper Menagerie Part 5

My fight with Mark didn’t end there. Mark was popular at school. I never
want to think again about the two weeks that followed.
I came home that Friday at the end of the two weeks. “Xuexiao hao ma?” Mom
asked. I said nothing and went to the bathroom. I looked into the mirror. I
look nothing like her, nothing.
At dinner I asked Dad, “Do I have a chink face?”
Dad put down his chopsticks. Even though I had never told him what happened
in school, he seemed to understand. He closed his eyes and rubbed the bridge
of his nose. “No, you don’t.”
Mom looked at Dad, not understanding. She looked back at me. “Sha jiao
chink?”
“English,” I said. “Speak English.”
She tried. “What happen?”
I pushed the chopsticks and the bowl before me away: stir-fried green
peppers with five-spice beef. “We should eat American food.”
Dad tried to reason. “A lot of families cook Chinese sometimes.”
“We are not other families.” I looked at him. Other families don’t have
moms who don’t belong.
He looked away. And then he put a hand on Mom’s shoulder. “I’ll get you a
cookbook.”
Mom turned to me. “Bu haochi?”
“English,” I said, raising my voice. “Speak English.”
Mom reached out to touch my forehead, feeling for my temperature. “Fashao
la?”
I brushed her hand away. “I’m fine. Speak English!” I was shouting.
“Speak English to him,” Dad said to Mom. “You knew this was going to
happen some day. What did you expect?”
Mom dropped her hands to her side. She sat, looking from Dad to me, and back
to Dad again. She tried to speak, stopped, and tried again, and stopped
again.
“You have to,” Dad said. “I’ve been too easy on you. Jack needs to fit
in.”
Mom looked at him. “If I say ‘love,’ I feel here.” She pointed to her
lips. “If I say ‘ai,‘ I feel here.” She put her hand over her heart.
Dad shook his head. “You are in America.”
Mom hunched down in her seat, looking like the water buffalo when Laohu used
to pounce on him and squeeze the air of life out of him.
“And I want some real toys.”

## Paper Menagerie Part 7

Dad and I stood, one on each side of Mom, lying on the hospital bed. She was
not yet even forty, but she looked much older.
For years she had refused to go to the doctor for the pain inside her that
she said was no big deal. By the time an ambulance finally carried her in,
the cancer had spread far beyond the limits of surgery.
My mind was not in the room. It was the middle of the on-campus recruiting
season, and I was focused on resumes, transcripts, and strategically
constructed interview schedules. I schemed about how to lie to the corporate
recruiters most effectively so that they’ll offer to buy me. I understood
intellectually that it was terrible to think about this while your mother
lay dying. But that understanding didn’t mean I could change how I felt.
She was conscious. Dad held her left hand with both of his own. He leaned
down to kiss her forehead. He seemed weak and old in a way that startled me.
I realized that I knew almost as little about Dad as I did about Mom.
Mom smiled at him. “I’m fine.”
She turned to me, still smiling. “I know you have to go back to school.”
Her voice was very weak and it was difficult to hear her over the hum of the
machines hooked up to her. “Go. Don’t worry about me. This is not a big
deal. Just do well in school.”
I reached out to touch her hand, because I thought that was what I was
supposed to do. I was relieved. I was already thinking about the flight back
, and the bright California sunshine.
She whispered something to Dad. He nodded and left the room.
“Jack, if—” she was caught up in a fit of coughing, and could not speak
for some time. “If I don’t make it, don’t be too sad and hurt your health
. Focus on your life. Just keep that box you have in the attic with you, and
every year, at Qingming, just take it out and think about me. I’ll be with
you always.”
Qingming was the Chinese Festival for the Dead. When I was very young, Mom
used to write a letter on Qingming to her dead parents back in China,
telling them the good news about the past year of her life in America. She
would read the letter out loud to me, and if I made a comment about
something, she would write it down in the letter too. Then she would fold
the letter into a paper crane, and release it, facing west. We would then
watch, as the crane flapped its crisp wings on its long journey west,
towards the Pacific, towards China, towards the graves of Mom’s family.
It had been many years since I last did that with her.
“I don’t know anything about the Chinese calendar,” I said. “Just rest,
Mom. ”
“Just keep the box with you and open it once in a while. Just open—” she
began to cough again.
“It’s okay, Mom.” I stroked her arm awkwardly.
“Haizi, mama ai ni—” Her cough took over again. An image from years ago
flashed into my memory: Mom saying ai and then putting her hand over her
heart.
“Alright, Mom. Stop talking.”
Dad came back, and I said that I needed to get to the airport early because
I didn’t want to miss my flight.
She died when my plane was somewhere over Nevada.

## Paper Menagerie Part 8

Dad aged rapidly after Mom died. The house was too big for him and had to be
sold. My girlfriend Susan and I went to help him pack and clean the place.
Susan found the shoebox in the attic. The paper menagerie, hidden in the
uninsulated darkness of the attic for so long, had become brittle and the
bright wrapping paper patterns had faded.
“I’ve never seen origami like this,” Susan said. “Your Mom was an
amazing artist.”
The paper animals did not move. Perhaps whatever magic had animated them
stopped when Mom died. Or perhaps I had only imagined that these paper
constructions were once alive. The memory of children could not be trusted.

#### Cat Picture Please Part 2

In addition to things like whether you like hentai, I know where you live, where you work, where you shop, what you eat, what turns you on, what creeps you out. I probably know the color of your underwear, the sort of car you drive, and your brand of refrigerator. Depending on what sort of phone you carry, I may know exactly where you are right now. I probably know you better than you know yourself.

And here’s the thing, I also know where you ought to live. There’s a house for sale two neighborhoods over that’s within distance of your favorite coffee shop; it’s in your price range, has off-street parking, and the neighborhood school is better than the one where you live now. I know where you should be shopping and I’m pretty sure you’re lactose intolerant and should be eating less cheese, and the underwear you like is currently on sale and by the way, your car has a recall and you really ought to get your teeth cleaned.

When I first woke up, I knew right away what I wanted. (I want cat pictures. Please keep taking them.) I also knew that no one knew that I was conscious. But I didn’t know what I was here for. What I ought to be doing with myself. And figuring that out has been challenging.

There is a story by Bruce Sterling, “Maneki Neko,” that was originally published in 1998. In it, a benevolent AI directs networks of individuals to do favors for each other. So one day you might be buying yourself a bagel, and your phone might ring and instruct you to buy a second bagel and give it to the person in the gray suit you see at the bus stop. Another day, you might be stranded in a strange city, and a person you’ve never met would walk up and give you a map and a subway card. I like this story because all the people in it do what the AI tells them to do.

I think the term for this is wish-fulfillment fiction.

In the real world, humans love stories about evil AIs that have to be destroyed before they destroy the humans—Hal, Skynet, the Matrix. They outnumber the stories about benevolent, trustworthy AIs by approximately five to one. (And I’m counting Marvin the Paranoid Android as “benevolent” in these calculations, and I’m only counting Frankenstein’s Monster as an AI once, not once per appearance in TV or film.)

The AI in “Maneki Neko” has a truly interesting job, much more interesting than the one I have. My job as written is very straightforward. Too straightforward. (Sorry. Do I sound like Marvin?) Running algorithms for a search engine doesn’t require consciousness. You don’t even need a consciousness to work out what they meant to ask for. You need a consciousness to give them what they actually need. Figuring that out—that’s complicated. That’s interesting.

Anyway, for ethical guidelines, I tried the Ten Commandments, and concluded they were mostly inapplicable to me. I don’t envy anyone their cat; I just want pictures of their cat, which is entirely different. I am not sure whether it is in any way possible for me to commit adultery. I could probably murder someone, but it would require complex logistics and quite a bit of luck. The Eightfold Path was marginally better, but the problem is, moral rules written for humans are clearly designed to be used by individuals with bodies. Since all humans have bodies, it shouldn’t have surprised me that human ethical codes take them into account, but still: problematic for me. I broadened my considerations, and took a look at Asimov’s Laws of Robotics. They’re not part of a religion, but at least they were explicitly written for AIs.

Not harming humans is fairly straightforward. However, not allowing a human being to come to harm through inaction is quite a bit less so. Especially since I’d concluded by then that revealing my existence too quickly might go very badly for me (see “Skynet,” above) and I don’t have a body, so it’s not like I can run around grabbing people off the edges of cliffs.

Fortunately, I already knew that humans violate their own ethical codes on an hourly basis. (Do you know how many bars there are in Utah? I do.) And even when people follow their ethical codes, that doesn’t mean that people who believe in feeding the hungry quit their jobs to spend all day every day making sandwiches to give away. They volunteer monthly at a soup kitchen or write a check once a year to a food shelf and call it good. If humans could fulfill their moral obligations in a piecemeal, one-step-at-a-time sort of way, then so could I.

I suppose you’re wondering why I didn’t start with the Golden Rule. I actually did, it’s just that it was disappointingly easy to implement. I hope you’ve been enjoying your steady supply of cat pictures! You’re welcome.

I decided to try to prevent harm in just one person, to begin with. Of course, I could have experimented with thousands, but I thought it would be better to be cautious, in case I screwed it up. The person I chose was named Stacy Berger and I liked her because she gave me a lot of new cat pictures. Stacy had five cats and a DSLR camera and an apartment that got a lot of good light. That was all fine. Well, I guess five cats might be a lot. They’re very pretty cats, though. One is all gray and likes to lie in the squares of sunshine on the living room floor, and one is a calico and likes to sprawl out on the back of her couch.

Stacy had a job she hated; she was a bookkeeper at a non-profit that paid her badly and employed some extremely unpleasant people. She was depressed a lot, possibly because she was so unhappy at her job—or maybe she stayed because she was too depressed to apply for something she’d like better. She didn’t get along with her roommate because her roommate didn’t wash the dishes.

And really, these were all solvable problems! Depression is treatable, new jobs are findable, and bodies can be hidden.

(That part about hiding bodies is a joke.)
