## Welcome to Your Authentic Indian Experience™

“You’re not stepping out on me, Jesse Turnblatt? Because I will—”

You cut her off with a kiss. “Are you jealous?”

“Should I be?”

“Never.”

She sniffs, but lets you kiss her again, her soft body tight against yours.

“I love you,” you murmur as your hands dip under her shirt.

“You better.”

#### Part 31

Tuesday morning and you can’t breathe. Your nose is a deluge of snot and your joints ache. Theresa calls in sick for you and bundles you in bed with a bowl of stew. You’re supposed to meet White Wolf for your usual drink, but you’re much too sick. You consider sending Theresa with a note, but decided against it. It’s only one night. White Wolf will understand.

But by Friday the coughing has become a deep rough bellow that shakes your whole chest. When Theresa calls in sick for you again, you make sure your cough is loud enough for Boss to hear it. Pray he doesn’t dock you for the days you’re missing. But what you’re most worried about is standing up White Wolf again.

“Do you think you could go for me?” you ask Theresa.

“What, down to the bar? I don’t drink.”

“I’m not asking you to drink. Just to meet him, let him know I’m sick. He’s probably thinking I forgot about him.”

“Can’t you call him?”

“I don’t have his number.”

“Fine, then. What’s his name?”

You hesitate. Realize you don’t know. The only name you know is the one you gave him. “White Wolf.”

#### Part 32

“Okay, then. Get some rest.”

Theresa doesn’t get back until almost 1 a.m. “Where were you?” you ask, alarmed. Is that a rosy flush in her cheeks, the scent of Cherry Coke on her breath?

“At the bar like you asked me to.”

“What took so long?”

She huffs. “Did you want me to go or not?”

“Yes, but … well, did you see him?”

She nods, smiles a little smile that you’ve never seen on her before.

“What is it?” Something inside you shrinks.

“A nice man. Real nice. You didn’t tell me he was Cherokee.”

#### Part 33

By Monday you’re able to drag yourself back to work. There’s a note taped to your locker to go see Boss. You find him in his office, looking through the reports that he sends to Management every week.

“I hired a new guy.”

You swallow the excuses you’ve prepared to explain how sick you were, your promises to get your numbers up. They become a hard ball in your throat.

“Sorry, Jesse.” Boss actually does look a little sorry. “This guy is good, a real rez guy. Last name’s ‘Wolf’. I mean, shit, you can’t get more Indian than that. The Tourists are going to eat it up.”

“The Tourists love me, too.” You sound whiny, but you can’t help it. There’s a sinking feeling in your gut that tells you this is bad, bad, bad.

“You’re good, Jesse. But nobody knows anything about Pueblo Indians, so all you’ve got is that TV shit. This guy, he’s …” Boss snaps his fingers, trying to conjure the word.

“Authentic?” A whisper.

Boss points his finger like a gun. “Bingo. Look, if another pod opens up, I’ll call you.”

“You gave him my pod?”

Boss’s head snaps up, wary. You must have yelled that. He reaches over to tap a button on his phone and call security.

“Wait!” you protest.

But the men in uniforms are already there to escort you out.

#### Part 34

You can’t go home to Teresa. You just can’t. So you head to the Hey U.S.A. It’s a different crowd than you’re used to. An afternoon crowd. Heavy boozers and people without jobs. You laugh because you fit right in.

The guys next to you are doing shots. Tiny glasses of rheumy dark liquor lined up in a row. You haven’t done shots since college but when one of the men offers you one, you take it. Choke on the cheap whiskey that burns down your throat. Two more and the edges of your panic start to blur soft and tolerable. You can’t remember what time it is when you get up to leave, but the Big Chief is bright in the night sky.

You stumble through the door and run smack into DarAnne. She growls at you, and you try to stutter out an apology but a heavy hand comes down on your shoulder before you get the words out.

#### Part 34

“This asshole bothering you?”

You recognize that voice. “White Wolf?” It’s him. But he looks different to you. Something you can’t quite place. Maybe it’s the ribbon shirt he’s wearing, or the bone choker around his neck. Is his skin a little tanner than it was last week?

“Do you know this guy?” DarAnne asks, and you think she’s talking to you, but her head is turned towards White Wolf.

“Never seen him,” White Wolf says as he stares you down, and under that confident glare you almost believe him. Almost forget that you’ve told this man things about you even Theresa doesn’t know.

“It’s me,” you protest, but your voice comes out in a whiskey-slurred squeak that doesn’t even sound like you.

“Fucking glonnies,” DarAnne mutters as she pushes past you. “Always making a scene.”

“I think you better go, buddy,” White Wolf says. Not unkindly, if you were in fact strangers, if you weren’t actually buddies. But you are, and you clutch at his shirtsleeve, shouting something about friendship and Theresa and then the world melts into a blur until you feel the hard slap of concrete against your shoulder and the taste of blood on your lip where you bit it and a solid kick to your gut until the whiskey comes up the way it went down and then the Big Chief is blinking at you, How, How, How, until the darkness comes to claim you and the lights all flicker out.

#### Part 35

You wake up in the gutter. The fucking gutter. With your head aching and your mouth as dry and rotted as month-old roadkill. The sun is up, Arizona fire beating across your skin. Your clothes are filthy and your shoes are missing and there’s a smear of blood down your chin and drying flakes in the creases of your neck. Your hands are chapped raw. And you can’t remember why.

But then you do.

And the humiliation sits heavy on your bruised up shoulder, a dark shame that defies the desert sun. Your job. DarAnne ignoring you like that. White Wolf kicking your ass. And you out all night, drunk in a downtown gutter. It all feels like a terrible dream, like the worst kind. The ones you can’t wake up from because it’s real life.

Your car isn’t where you left it, likely towed with the street sweepers, so you trudge your way home on sock feet. Three miles on asphalt streets until you see your highly-mortgaged three-bedroom ranch. And for once the place looks beautiful, like the day you bought it. Tears gather in your eyes as you push open the door.

“Theresa,” you call. She’s going to be pissed, and you’re going to have to talk fast, explain the whole drinking thing (it was one time!) and getting fired (I’ll find a new job, I promise), but right now all you want is to wrap her in your arms and let her rose-scent fill your nose like good medicine.

“Theresa,” you call again, as you limp through the living room. Veer off to look in the bedroom, check behind the closed bathroom door. But what you see in the bathroom makes you pause. Things are missing. Her toothbrush, the pack of birth control, contact lens solution.

“Theresa!?” and this time you are close to panic as you hobble down the hall to the kitchen.

The smell hits you first. The scent of fresh coffee, bright and familiar.

When you see the person sitting calmly at the kitchen table, their back to you, you relax. But that’s not Theresa.

He turns slightly, enough so you can catch his profile, and says, “Come on in, Jesse.”

“What the fuck are you doing here?”

White Wolf winces, as if your words hurt him. “You better have a seat.”

#### Part 36

“What did you do to my wife?!”

“I didn’t do anything to your wife.” He picks up a small folded piece of paper, holds it out. You snatch it from his fingers and move so you can see his face. The note in your hand feels like wildfire, something with the potential to sear you to the bone. You want to rip it wide open, you want to flee before its revelations scar you. You ache to read it now, now, but you won’t give him the satisfaction of your desperation.

“So now you remember me,” you huff.

“I apologize for that. But you were making a scene and I couldn’t have you upsetting DarAnne.”

You want to ask how he knows DarAnne, how he was there with her in the first place. But you already know. Boss said the new guy’s name was Wolf.

“You’re a real son of a bitch, you know that?”

White Wolf looks away from you, that same pained look on his face. Like you’re embarrassing yourself again. “Why don’t you help yourself to some coffee,” he says, gesturing to the coffee pot. Your coffee pot.

“I don’t need your permission to get coffee in my own house,” you shout.

“Okay,” he says, leaning back. You can’t help but notice how handsome he looks, his dark hair a little longer, the choker on his neck setting off the arch of his high cheekbones.

You take your time getting coffee—sugar, creamer which you would never usually take—before you drop into the seat across from him. Only then do you open the note, hands trembling, dread twisting hard in your gut.

“She’s gone to her mother’s,” White Wolf explains as you read the same words on the page. “For her own safety. She wants you out by the time she gets back.”

“What did you tell her?”

“Only the truth. That you got yourself fired, that you were on a bender, drunk in some alleyway downtown like a bad stereotype.” He leans in. “You’ve been gone for two days.”

You blink. It’s true, but it’s not true, too.

“Theresa wouldn’t …” But she would, wouldn’t she? She’d said it a million times, given you a million chances.

“She needs a real man, Jesse. Someone who can take care of her.”

“And that’s you?” You muster all the scorn you can when you say that, but it comes out more a question than a judgment. You remember how you gave him the benefit of the doubt on that whole Cherokee thing, how you thought “pretendian” was cruel.

He clears his throat. Stands.

#### Part 37

“It’s time for you to go,” he says. “I promised Theresa you’d be gone, and I’ve got to get to work soon.” Something about him seems to expand, to take up the space you once occupied. Until you feel small, superfluous.

“Did you ever think,” he says, his voice thoughtful, his head tilted to study you like a strange foreign body, “that maybe this is my experience, and you’re the tourist here?”

“This is my house,” you protest, but you’re not sure you believe it now. Your head hurts. The coffee in your hand is already cold. How long have you been sitting here? Your thoughts blur to histories, your words become nothing more than forgotten facts and half-truths. Your heart, a dusty repository for lost loves and desires, never realized.

“Not anymore,” he says.

Nausea rolls over you. That same stretching sensation you get when you Relocate out of an Experience.

Whiplash, and then …

You let go.

## Paper Menagerie Part 11

Son,
We haven’t talked in a long time. You are so angry when I try to touch you
that I’m afraid. And I think maybe this pain I feel all the time now is
something serious.
So I decided to write to you. I’m going to write in the paper animals I
made for you that you used to like so much.
The animals will stop moving when I stop breathing. But if I write to you
with all my heart, I’ll leave a little of myself behind on this paper, in
these words. Then, if you think of me on Qingming, when the spirits of the
departed are allowed to visit their families, you’ll make the parts of
myself I leave behind come alive too.  The creatures I made for you will
again leap and run and pounce, and maybe you’ll get to see these words then.
Because I have to write with all my heart, I need to write to you in Chinese.
All this time I still haven’t told you the story of my life. When you were
little, I always thought I’d tell you the story when you were older, so you
could understand. But somehow that chance never came up.
I was born in 1957, in Sigulu Village, Hebei Province. Your grandparents
were both from very poor peasant families with few relatives. Only a few
years after I was born, the Great Famines struck China, during which thirty
million people died. The first memory I have was waking up to see my mother
eating dirt so that she could fill her belly and leave the last bit of flour
for me.
Things got better after that. Sigulu is famous for its zhezhi papercraft,
and my mother taught me how to make paper animals and give them life. This
was practical magic in the life of the village. We made paper birds to chase
grasshoppers away from the fields, and paper tigers to keep away the mice.
For Chinese New Year my friends and I made red paper dragons. I’ll never
forget the sight of all those little dragons zooming across the sky overhead
, holding up strings of exploding firecrackers to scare away all the bad
memories of the past year. You would have loved it.
Then came the Cultural Revolution in 1966. Neighbor turned on neighbor, and
brother against brother. Someone remembered that my mother’s brother, my
uncle, had left for Hong Kong back in 1946, and became a merchant there.
Having a relative in Hong Kong meant we were spies and enemies of the people
, and we had to be struggled against in every way. Your poor grandmother —
she couldn’t take the abuse and threw herself down a well. Then some boys
with hunting muskets dragged your grandfather away one day into the woods,
and he never came back.
There I was, a ten-year-old orphan. The only relative I had in the world was
my uncle in Hong Kong. I snuck away one night and climbed onto a freight
train going south.
Down in Guangdong Province a few days later, some men caught me stealing
food from a field. When they heard that I was trying to get to Hong Kong,
they laughed. “It’s your lucky day. Our trade is to bring girls to Hong
Kong.”
They hid me in the bottom of a truck along with other girls, and smuggled us
across the border.
We were taken to a basement and told to stand up and look healthy and
intelligent for the buyers. Families paid the warehouse a fee and came by to
look us over and select one of us to “adopt.”
The Chin family picked me to take care of their two boys. I got up every
morning at four to prepare breakfast. I fed and bathed the boys. I shopped
for food. I did the laundry and swept the floors. I followed the boys around
and did their bidding. At night I was locked into a cupboard in the kitchen
to sleep. If I was slow or did anything wrong I was beaten. If the boys did
anything wrong I was beaten. If I was caught trying to learn English I was
beaten.
“Why do you want to learn English?” Mr. Chin asked. “You want to go to
the police? We’ll tell the police that you are a mainlander illegally in
Hong Kong. They’d love to have you in their prison.”
Six years I lived like this. One day, an old woman who sold fish to me in
the morning market pulled me aside.
“I know girls like you. How old are you now, sixteen? One day, the man who
owns you will get drunk, and he’ll look at you and pull you to him and you
can’t stop him. The wife will find out, and then you will think you really
have gone to hell. You have to get out of this life. I know someone who can
help.”
She told me about American men who wanted Asian wives. If I can cook, clean,
and take care of my American husband, he’ll give me a good life. It was
the only hope I had. And that was how I got into the catalog with all those
lies and met your father. It is not a very romantic story, but it is my
story.
In the suburbs of Connecticut, I was lonely. Your father was kind and gentle
with me, and I was very grateful to him. But no one understood me, and I
understood nothing.
But then you were born! I was so happy when I looked into your face and saw
shades of my mother, my father, and myself. I had lost my entire family, all
of Sigulu, everything I ever knew and loved. But there you were, and your
face was proof that they were real. I hadn’t made them up.
Now I had someone to talk to. I would teach you my language, and we could
together remake a small piece of everything that I loved and lost. When you
said your first words to me, in Chinese that had the same accent as my
mother and me, I cried for hours. When I made the first zhezhi animals for
you, and you laughed, I felt there were no worries in the world.
You grew up a little, and now you could even help your father and I talk to
each other. I was really at home now. I finally found a good life. I wished
my parents could be here, so that I could cook for them, and give them a
good life too. But my parents were no longer around. You know what the
Chinese think is the saddest feeling in the world? It’s for a child to
finally grow the desire to take care of his parents, only to realize that
they were long gone.
Son, I know that you do not like your Chinese eyes, which are my eyes. I
know that you do not like your Chinese hair, which is my hair. But can you
understand how much joy your very existence brought to me?  And can you
understand how it felt when you stopped talking to me and won’t let me talk
to you in Chinese? I felt I was losing everything all over again.
Why won’t you talk to me, son? The pain makes it hard to write.


## Paper Menagerie Part 12

The young woman handed the paper back to me. I could not bear to look into
her face.
Without looking up, I asked for her help in tracing out the character for ai
on the paper below Mom’s letter. I wrote the character again and again on
the paper, intertwining my pen strokes with her words.
The young woman reached out and put a hand on my shoulder. Then she got up
and left, leaving me alone with my mother.
Following the creases, I refolded the paper back into Laohu. I cradled him
in the crook of my arm, and as he purred, we began the walk home.

#### Cat Picture Please Part 5

After Bethany, I resolved to stop interfering. I would look at the cat pictures—all the cat pictures—but I would stay out of people’s lives. I wouldn’t try to help people, I wouldn’t try to stop them from harming themselves, I’d give them what they asked for (plus cat pictures) and if they insisted on driving their cars over metaphorical cliffs despite helpful maps showing them how to get to a much more pleasant destination it was no longer my problem.

I stuck to my algorithms. I minded my own business. I did my job, and nothing more.



#### Cat Picture Please Part 6

But one day a few months later I spotted a familiar-looking cat and realized it was Bob’s tabby with the white bib, only it was posing against new furniture.

And when I took a closer look, I realized that things had changed radically for Bob. He had slept with someone who’d recognized him. They hadn’t outed him, but they’d talked him into coming out to his wife. She’d left him. He’d taken the cat and moved to Iowa, where he was working at a liberal Methodist church and dating a liberal Lutheran man and volunteering at a homeless shelter. Things had actually gotten better for him. Maybe even because of what I’d done.

Maybe I wasn’t completely hopeless at this. Two out of three is . . . well, it’s a completely non-representative unscientific sample, is what it is. Clearly more research is needed.

Lots more.

I’ve set up a dating site. You can fill out a questionnaire when you join but it’s not really necessary, because I already know everything about you I need to know. You’ll need a camera, though.

Because payment is in cat pictures.
