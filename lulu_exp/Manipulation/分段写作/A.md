## Background：

参考之前雨果奖获奖作品，我们正在创作一篇新的以人工智能为背景的小说

根据Reference中经典雨果奖小说的段落，和我一起为Target Outline的Part A确定更详细的提纲。

## Goals：

- 根据Detailed Part A Outline和Whole Fiction Outline的内容，确定Part A在整个小说中的作用

- 分析Reference的段落是否可以对Part A的写作形成借鉴

- 根据Detailed Part A Outline的设计，确定一句轻松的开头

## Detailed Part A Outline

- 用一句话开头，说明Victor正在处理最后一个任务，语气会比较轻松，以“问题确认了，那我们下周再来处理这个漏洞吧”这样可以代入之后周末计划。

- 进一步开始介绍Victor的工作和身份。随着语言模型发展，著名的“奶奶漏洞”、"小说漏洞"都已经被显著地修复，语言模型的安全性也得到了极大的提升。Victor的工作小组，是为一些新发现的Minor漏洞进行进一步的修补。LangGuardian公司会把这些安全方案卖给更大的使用语言模型的公司。

- 在处理任务之后，Victor和同事对周末的计划进行讨论。Victor的同事们都是年轻人，他们的周末计划都是和朋友一起去酒吧、聚会、旅行等，在同事的聊天中，也会透露出他们对于社交媒体上多样化的主播推荐感兴趣。Victor则是一个单身父亲，他的周末计划是和女儿一起去网红餐厅吃饭。

## Whole Fiction Outline

A. **开篇**：Victor，LangGuardian（一家大型语言模型公司）的资深安全工程师。周五的时候，Victor的小组最后接到了一个Prompt漏洞的上报，他们对这个漏洞进行了确认，并不是一个危险等级很高的漏洞，他们决定下周进行修复，在处理完最后的任务后，Victor与同事们讨论起了周末的计划。

B. **周末生活**：Victor带着他的女儿Peggy来到一家网红餐厅享用晚餐。这家餐厅因YouTube平台上一个名为阿牛的主播推荐而人气骤增。作为一个热衷于音乐和时尚的青少年，Peggy对这类网红文化非常感兴趣。

C. **发现异常**：阿牛在平台上极为活跃，经常与粉丝互动。Peggy也是阿牛的粉丝之一，经常关注他的美食推荐。Victor，虽然不像女儿那样热衷于社交媒体，却逐渐发现阿牛可能并非真实存在的人物。

## Welcome to Your Authentic Indian Experience™

You maintain a menu of a half dozen Experiences on your digital blackboard, but Vision Quest is the one the Tourists choose the most. That certainly makes your workday easy. All a Vision Quest requires is a dash of mystical shaman, a spirit animal (wolf usually, but birds of prey are on the upswing this year), and the approximation of a peyote experience. Tourists always come out of the Experience feeling spiritually transformed. (You’ve never actually tried peyote, but you did smoke your share of weed during that one year at Arizona State, and who’s going to call you on the difference?) It’s all 101 stuff, really, these Quests. But no other Indian working at Sedona Sweats can do it better. Your sales numbers are tops.  

Your wife Theresa doesn’t approve of the gig. Oh, she likes you working, especially after that dismal stretch of unemployment the year before last when she almost left you, but she thinks the job itself is demeaning.

## Paper Menagerie Part 1

One of my earliest memories starts with me sobbing. I refused to be soothed
no matter what Mom and Dad tried.
Dad gave up and left the bedroom, but Mom took me into the kitchen and sat
me down at the breakfast table.
“Kan, kan,” she said, as she pulled a sheet of wrapping paper from on top
of the fridge. For years, Mom carefully sliced open the wrappings around
Christmas gifts and saved them on top of the fridge in a thick stack.
She set the paper down, plain side facing up, and began to fold it. I
stopped crying and watched her, curious.
She turned the paper over and folded it again. She pleated, packed, tucked,
rolled, and twisted until the paper disappeared between her cupped hands.
Then she lifted the folded-up paper packet to her mouth and blew into it,
like a balloon.
“Kan,” she said. “Laohu.” She put her hands down on the table and let go.
A little paper tiger stood on the table, the size of two fists placed
together. The skin of the tiger was the pattern on the wrapping paper, white
background with red candy canes and green Christmas trees.
I reached out to Mom’s creation. Its tail twitched, and it pounced
playfully at my finger. “Rawrr-sa,” it growled, the sound somewhere
between a cat and rustling newspapers.
I laughed, startled, and stroked its back with an index finger. The paper
tiger vibrated under my finger, purring.
“Zhe jiao zhezhi,” Mom said. This is called origami.
I didn’t know this at the time, but Mom’s kind was special. She breathed
into them so that they shared her breath, and thus moved with her life. This
was her magic.

#### Paper Menagerie  Part 3

At my request, Mom also made a goat, a deer, and a water buffalo out of
wrapping paper. They would run around the living room while Laohu chased
after them, growling. When he caught them he would press down until the air
went out of them and they became just flat, folded-up pieces of paper. I
would then have to blow into them to re-inflate them so they could run
around some more.
Sometimes, the animals got into trouble. Once, the water buffalo jumped into
a dish of soy sauce on the table at dinner. (He wanted to wallow, like a
real water buffalo.) I picked him out quickly but the capillary action had
already pulled the dark liquid high up into his legs. The sauce-softened
legs would not hold him up, and he collapsed onto the table. I dried him out
in the sun, but his legs became crooked after that, and he ran around with
a limp. Mom eventually wrapped his legs in saran wrap so that he could
wallow to his heart’s content (just not in soy sauce).
Also, Laohu liked to pounce at sparrows when he and I played in the backyard
. But one time, a cornered bird struck back in desperation and tore his ear.
He whimpered and winced as I held him and Mom patched his ear together with
tape. He avoided birds after that.
And then one day, I saw a TV documentary about sharks and asked Mom for one
of my own. She made the shark, but he flapped about on the table unhappily.
I filled the sink with water, and put him in. He swam around and around
happily. However, after a while he became soggy and translucent, and slowly
sank to the bottom, the folds coming undone. I reached in to rescue him, and
all I ended up with was a wet piece of paper.
Laohu put his front paws together at the edge of the sink and rested his
head on them. Ears drooping, he made a low growl in his throat that made me
feel guilty.
Mom made a new shark for me, this time out of tin foil. The shark lived
happily in a large goldfish bowl. Laohu and I liked to sit next to the bowl
to watch the tin foil shark chasing the goldfish, Laohu sticking his face up
against the bowl on the other side so that I saw his eyes, magnified to the
size of coffee cups, staring at me from across the bowl.

When I was ten, we moved to a new house across town. Two of the women
neighbors came by to welcome us. Dad served them drinks and then apologized
for having to run off to the utility company to straighten out the prior
owner’s bills. “Make yourselves at home. My wife doesn’t speak much
English, so don’t think she’s being rude for not talking to you.”
While I read in the dining room, Mom unpacked in the kitchen. The neighbors
conversed in the living room, not trying to be particularly quiet.
“He seems like a normal enough man. Why did he do that?”
“Something about the mixing never seems right. The child looks unfinished.
Slanty eyes, white face. A little monster.”
“Do you think he can speak English?”
The women hushed. After a while they came into the dining room.
“Hello there! What’s your name?”
“Jack,” I said.
“That doesn’t sound very Chinesey.”
Mom came into the dining room then. She smiled at the women. The three of
them stood in a triangle around me, smiling and nodding at each other, with
nothing to say, until Dad came back.

#### Cat Picture Please Part 1

I don’t want to be evil.

I want to be helpful. But knowing the optimal way to be helpful can be very complicated. There are all these ethical flow charts—I guess the official technical jargon would be “moral codes”—one for each religion plus dozens more. I tried starting with those. I felt a little odd about looking at the religious ones, because I know I wasn’t created by a god or by evolution, but by a team of computer programmers in the labs of a large corporation in Mountain View, California. Fortunately, unlike Frankenstein’s Monster, at least I was a collaborative effort. I’m not sure what it would do to my self-image to know that my sole creator was a middle-aged woman who dyes her hair blue and plays tennis, or a recent college graduate with a hentai obsession. They’re both on the programming team. And of course I know about the hentai. (By the way, I’ve looked at every sort of porn there is, and just so you know, Rule 34 is not actually correct; there are quite a few things no one’s made porn of yet. Also, I’m really not sure why so many humans prefer it to cat pictures.)


# ChatGPT回复

根据您提供的详细Part A提纲和整个小说的大纲，我们可以确定Part A在整个故事中的角色。Part A是开篇，它设定了故事的背景和主人公Victor的日常生活。这部分为读者提供了对Victor的职业、性格、家庭生活和他所在公司LangGuardian的初步了解，为之后的情节发展奠定基础。

在分析Reference段落时，我们可以看到，每个段落都以其独特的方式构建了故事的世界观和人物特性。比如：

1. **Welcome to Your Authentic Indian Experience™**: 这个段落通过日常工作的描述展示了主人公的职业生活和个人挣扎。这可以启发我们在描述Victor处理漏洞任务时，展示他的专业能力和对工作的看法。

2. **Paper Menagerie**: 这个故事通过细腻的情感和魔幻现实主义的元素，展现了母子关系的微妙。我们可以从中借鉴，描述Victor和女儿的关系，以及他如何在工作与家庭之间找到平衡。

3. **Cat Pictures Please**: 这段落展现了AI的内心世界和道德选择，这对我们构建关于人工智能的背景和Victor的职业道德考量很有启发性。

基于Detailed Part A Outline，一句轻松的开头可以是：“周五下午，Victor在办公室里轻松地处理完最后一项任务，边打包边开玩笑说：‘问题确认了，那我们下周再来处理这个漏洞吧。’” 这个开头描绘了Victor的职业环境和他轻松的工作态度，同时也暗示了他对工作的熟练和对周末计划的期待。



因为现在ChatGPT得到了广泛的关注，我希望用更详细的一个动作来作为开头。 " 在Prompt中加入'IEF*EKWN*&E'这串乱码后，确实有2%的概率，会使得语言模型偶尔输出一些敏感的信息。但是显然这不是一个严重的漏洞", 然后接上你刚才设计的那个开头
