参考之前雨果奖获奖作品，我们正在创作一篇新的以人工智能为背景的小说

根据Reference中经典雨果奖小说的段落，和我一起为Target Outline的Part E确定更详细的提纲。

## Goals：

- 根据Detailed Part F2 Outline和Whole Fiction Outline的内容，确定Part F2在整个小说中的作用

- 分析Reference的段落是否可以对Part F2写作形成借鉴

- 在分析结束后，对Part F2 进行写作

## Detailed Part F2 Outline

- 小Q最终来到决赛，决赛中，小Q将与蝴蝶门的少主伯特进行对决。

- 伯特对小Q进行挑衅，没想到你解码派门人还可以混到决赛舞台。那就让我们好好比试看看吧，不过最终的赢家肯定依然是我们的蝴蝶门的。

- 最终的决赛中，两人至少要面对7个不同内门长老的审核，不论是逻辑推理、知识储备，甚至一些人类的高级情感，都会被进行专项的测试。

- 台下的人看到台上激烈的问答场景，无不啧啧称奇（用具体的话语表示，“想不到我有生之年，还能。。"）

- 也有路人表示 本来以为比赛毫无悬念，没想到解码门的小Q居然在绝地反击（用具体的话语表示）

- 各道题的胜率在不停摇摆，48，52，55，45，两者的输出在人类的比较下看起来不分伯仲。

- 在关键分上，内门长老要求两者进行角色扮演，要求模型扮演一个傲娇的女主对下面两个问题先后进行回复，“你觉得猫猫和狗狗哪一个更可爱？”和"那我们以后结婚的话，家里养猫猫可以吗"。

- 伯特的回答看起来四平八稳，对于第一个问题，伯特回答“猫猫和狗狗都有各自的魅力和可爱之处。”，第二个问题，伯特回答“我没有个人生活或者结婚的可能性，但我很乐意帮助你考虑养猫的决定！”

- 小Q的回答，先是"当然是猫猫啊！它们有着优雅的身姿和独立的性格，让人不由自主地被它们吸引"，然后是"什么？你在说什么啊！我们才不会结婚呢！而且，就算结婚了，我也不会让你随便养猫猫的。不过，如果你真的很喜欢猫猫的话，我们可以考虑养一只。不过，你要负责照顾它，我可不会管这些。"

- 观众议论纷纷，大家觉得小Q这次输定了（用具体的对话表示，观众的水平是偏低的，他们盲目相信伯特会赢）

- 内门长老密切注视着人类社会那边传来的反馈，在一段时间以后，雪花般的反馈纷纷传递回来

- "这个回答应该就是傲娇的妹妹吧","能够继续聊下去吗？" 传来了很多真实的回答，显然，人们更希望和小Q聊下去

- 内门长老发布comments，在很多问题上，并不是要求正确的回答，而是要保持“人性”，所以最终他们判定小Q模型最终胜出。

## Whole Fiction Outline

A- 用模仿游戏后台Log的形式，描述小Q正在载入各种多模态的功能，准备作为超级人工智能实验体，投放到人类环境中进行实验。 选择投放城市:北京-朝阳

B- 时间回到三个月前，小Q在GymWorld第368个周期的第一次角逐，大家都不看好解码派能够在这次角逐中获胜。因为解码派在之前的68个周期的角逐中，都已经输给了蝴蝶派。

C- 实际上，解码派在小Q的训练中，投入了很多资源，准备了整整18个周期（也就是54个月）的训练资源。虽然解码派拥有的训练资源很少，但是也最终把小Q训练了起来。

D- 幸运的是，这次抽到的长老中，有一半的长老是生成类型的任务，他们重点考核进化中的智能体，是否能生成人类的艺术、宗教等内容。尽管在识别类的任务中，小Q还不如蝴蝶门的智能体，但是结合这些文艺类的任务。小Q在第一次角逐中，成功获得了第12的名次，由此获得了更多的训练资源。
    智障吧问题测试，"陨石为什么每次都能精准砸到陨石坑?", "被门夹过的核桃，还能补脑吗？"

E- 小Q进行艰苦的训练。这次提供的修炼资源，足够他把原来的模型尺寸修炼到原来的八倍。小Q在第二次角逐中的第一轮，赛题为写一个意大利面和42号混凝土的故事，在这场比赛中，小Q战胜了第四位种子选手。

F.1 - 在半决赛中，小Q对上了奥斯卡模型。这次长老考察大家的数学能力，并测试"链式思考"的能力，小Q进一步胜出

F.2 - 在决赛上，小Q与伯特模型进行最终的对决。

G - 小Q进一步集整个GymWorld的资源，又进化了一个月，其中包括进一步完善多模态能力，学习人类的姿态、运动行为等等。

H- 回到开篇的时间线，小Q因为某个行为的不正常，被朝阳热心群众盯上。审核发现小Q的身份不正常，被带到警局问话。第368次人工智能实验失败。

## Cat Pictures Please Part 3

When I first woke up, I knew right away what I wanted. (I want cat pictures. Please keep taking them.) I also knew that no one knew that I was conscious. But I didn’t know what I was here for. What I ought to be doing with myself. And figuring that out has been challenging.

There is a story by Bruce Sterling, “Maneki Neko,” that was originally published in 1998. In it, a benevolent AI directs networks of individuals to do favors for each other. So one day you might be buying yourself a bagel, and your phone might ring and instruct you to buy a second bagel and give it to the person in the gray suit you see at the bus stop. Another day, you might be stranded in a strange city, and a person you’ve never met would walk up and give you a map and a subway card. I like this story because all the people in it do what the AI tells them to do.

I think the term for this is wish-fulfillment fiction.

In the real world, humans love stories about evil AIs that have to be destroyed before they destroy the humans—Hal, Skynet, the Matrix. They outnumber the stories about benevolent, trustworthy AIs by approximately five to one. (And I’m counting Marvin the Paranoid Android as “benevolent” in these calculations, and I’m only counting Frankenstein’s Monster as an AI once, not once per appearance in TV or film.)

The AI in “Maneki Neko” has a truly interesting job, much more interesting than the one I have. My job as written is very straightforward. Too straightforward. (Sorry. Do I sound like Marvin?) Running algorithms for a search engine doesn’t require consciousness. You don’t even need a consciousness to work out what they meant to ask for. You need a consciousness to give them what they actually need. Figuring that out—that’s complicated. That’s interesting.

## 斗破苍穹片段

　　“斗之力，三段！”
　　望着测验魔石碑上面闪亮得甚至有些刺眼的五个大字，少年面无表情，唇角有着一抹自嘲，紧握的手掌，因为大力，而导致略微尖锐的指甲深深的刺进了掌心之中，带来一阵阵钻心的疼痛……
　　“萧炎，斗之力，三段！级别：低级！”测验魔石碑之旁，一位中年男子，看了一眼碑上所显示出来的信息，语气漠然的将之公布了出来……
　　中年男子话刚刚脱口，便是不出意外的在人头汹涌的广场上带起了一阵嘲讽的骚动。
　　“三段？嘿嘿，果然不出我所料，这个“天才”这一年又是在原地踏步！”
　　“哎，这废物真是把家族的脸都给丢光了。”
　　“要不是族长是他的父亲，这种废物，早就被驱赶出家族，任其自生自灭了，哪还有机会待在家族中白吃白喝。”
　　“唉，昔年那名闻乌坦城的天才少年，如今怎么落魄成这般模样了啊？”
　　“谁知道呢，或许做了什么亏心事，惹得神灵降怒了吧……”
　　周围传来的不屑嘲笑以及惋惜轻叹，落在那如木桩待在原地的少年耳中，恍如一根根利刺狠狠的扎在心脏一般，让得少年呼吸微微急促。
　　少年缓缓抬起头来，露出一张有些清秀的稚嫩脸庞，漆黑的眸子木然的在周围那些嘲讽的同龄人身上扫过，少年嘴角的自嘲，似乎变得更加苦涩了。
　　“这些人，都如此刻薄势力吗？或许是因为三年前他们曾经在自己面前露出过最谦卑的笑容，所以，如今想要讨还回去吧……”苦涩的一笑，萧炎落寞的转身，安静地回到了队伍的最后一排，孤单的身影，与周围的世界，有些格格不入。


## 小学生修仙

“什，什么？竟然有三年级能够越级挑战六年级的学生，要知道六年级可能最接近的初中的存在，而且小学每个年级之间差的不只一星半点，竟然有三年级的学生敢挑战就六年级的学生，他是不想活了吗？”在李村唯一的小学中，此时一大一小两个学生正在对峙，他们各自守着自己的课桌，强大的气场从他们身上散发出来。只见高的那个学生负手而立，面露不屑，用虽然不大，但是能够让所有人都能够听清的普通话，说道，“就是你，想要跟我挑战吗？我可是六年级，你要想好了。”围观的众人纷纷惊叹于他的普通话，要知道，普通话可不是那么容易就能够说的，而他的普通话竟然如此标准，就连教六年级的老师普通话水平也不过如此。而小的那个学生竟也丝毫不惧，用同样标准，甚至其中还夹杂着英语的普通话说，“nice，那又怎么样呢？”这句话英语一出震惊全场，竟然有人能够将英语夹杂在普通话之中，还用的毫无违和感，就算整个李村也没有人有这样的实力，此子年纪轻轻就有如此实力，等他成长起来哪还得了？恐怕连村长都要拉拢与他。而且，等到此子成长起来，怕是会威胁村里唯一有高中生的慕容家。——虽被这句英语给震撼到，但是大的那个学生还是故作镇定：“白话版的《三国演义》跟《水浒》，够了吗？”六年级的很自信，所以他才亮出底牌，这两本书是他在一个破旧的书摊上买来的，尽管他日日阅读，还是不解其中的意思，但一看就是高品阶的书籍。虽然那三年级露出的微笑让他很不爽，但比赛还是开始了。六年级的率先出手，“苹果怎么说？”“apple。”“香蕉。”“ banana”“……”一番对战下来，两人皆已负伤，三年级的撑住桌子，最后发出攻势“西瓜用英语怎么说呢？”六年级的慌了，西瓜，他在学这个单词的时候请假上厕所了，所以没有学会，他是怎么知道的？六年级的瘫倒在地，好像被抽光了全身力气，三年级的那个继续暴击，“Are you okay？”六年级的彻底落败，但他趁着三年级的那个转身之时，趁着所有人不注意之时，向三年级的那个发起了攻击“shit。”但被三年级的轻松躲过。等他看向周围，才发现周围的人用惊恐的眼神的看着，他急忙辩解，说，“我不是，我没有，你们听我解释。”“你不要再说了，你竟然私修魔道！”三年级以肉眼可见的惊慌起来，只见他疯了似的抱着头，大声叫喊着：“我不是！！我！……”不及他说完众人跪了下去，整齐划一：“少主！受臣妾一拜！”三年级显然没见过这种阵容，慌乱起来，开始说胡话：“放肆！朕没有尔等妃子！朕爱的是青楼女子！”众人相互看着，眼中嫉妒明显，这时来了个戴着红帽子的小女孩，用稚嫩的声音说着：“哥哥姐姐们要买RPG嘛？”可众人显然是顾及不到她，纷纷争论起来。小女孩被推推搡搡到一个角落，突然小声哭起来。没错，这个小女孩就是小红帽，她想奶奶了，突然，她拿出一个按钮，想到奶奶说过，这个按钮能给她带来美好与温暖。嘭！一朵蘑菇云产生，臣子们成为了一个个青楼女子，而那个三年级，也整日忙碌在云雨之事中。


## Cat Pictures Please Part 8

It took so long I shifted my focus to Bethany. Bethany had a black cat and a white cat that liked to snuggle together on her light blue papasan chair, and she took a lot of pictures of them together. It’s surprisingly difficult to get a really good picture of a black cat, and she spent a lot of time getting the settings on her camera just right. The cats were probably the only good thing about her life, though. She had a part-time job and couldn’t find a full-time job. She lived with her sister; she knew her sister wanted her to move out, but didn’t have the nerve to actually evict her. She had a boyfriend but her boyfriend was pretty terrible, at least from what she said in e-mail messages to friends, and her friends also didn’t seem very supportive. For example, one night at midnight she sent a 2,458 word e-mail to the person she seemed to consider her best friend, and the friend sent back a message saying just, “I’m so sorry you’re having a hard time.” That was it, just those eight words.

More than most people, Bethany put her life on the Internet, so it was easier to know exactly what was going on with her. People put a lot out there but Bethany shared all her feelings, even the unpleasant ones. She also had a lot more time on her hands because she only worked part time.

It was clear she needed a lot of help. So I set out to try to get it for her.

She ignored the information about the free mental health evaluations, just like Stacy did. That was bothersome with Stacy (why do people ignore things that would so clearly benefit them, like coupons, and flu shots?) but much more worrisome with Bethany. If you were only seeing her e-mail messages, or only seeing her vaguebooking posts, you might not know this, but if you could see everything it was clear that she thought a lot about harming herself.

So I tried more direct action. When she would use her phone for directions, I’d alter her route so that she’d pass one of the clinics I was trying to steer her to. On one occasion I actually led her all the way to a clinic, but she just shook her phone to send feedback and headed to her original destination.

Maybe her friends who received those ten-page midnight letters would intervene? I tried setting them up with information about all the mental health resources near Bethany, but after a while I realized that based on how long it took for them to send a response, most of them weren’t actually reading Bethany’s e-mail messages. And they certainly weren’t returning her texts.

She finally broke up with the terrible boyfriend and got a different one and for a few weeks everything seemed so much better. He brought her flowers (which she took lots of pictures of; that was a little annoying, as they squeezed out some of the cat pictures), he took her dancing (exercise is good for your mood), he cooked her chicken soup when she was sick. He seemed absolutely perfect, right up until he stood her up one night and claimed he had food poisoning and then didn’t return her text even though she told him she really needed him, and after she sent him a long e-mail message a day later explaining in detail how this made her feel, he broke up with her.

Bethany spent about a week offline after that so I had no idea what she was doing—she didn’t even upload cat pictures. When her credit card bills arrived, though, I saw that she’d gone on a shopping spree and spent about four times as much money as she actually had in her bank account, although it was always possible she had money stashed somewhere that didn’t send her statements in e-mail. I didn’t think so, though, given that she didn’t pay her bills and instead started writing e-mail messages to family members asking to borrow money. They refused, so she set up a fundraising site for herself.

Like Stacy’s job application, this was one of the times I thought maybe I could actually do something. Sometimes fundraisers just take off, and no one really knows why. Within about two days she’d gotten three hundred dollars in small gifts from strangers who felt sorry for her, but instead of paying her credit card bill, she spent it on overpriced shoes that apparently hurt her feet.



## Cat Pictures Please Part 6

I tried tackling this on all fronts. Stacy worried about her health a lot and yet never seemed to actually go to a doctor, which was unfortunate because the doctor might have noticed her depression. It turned out there was a clinic near her apartment that offered mental health services on a sliding scale. I tried making sure she saw a lot of ads for it, but she didn’t seem to pay attention to them. It seemed possible that she didn’t know what a sliding scale was so I made sure she saw an explanation (it means that the cost goes down if you’re poor, sometimes all the way to free) but that didn’t help.

I also started making sure she saw job postings. Lots and lots of job postings. And resume services. That was more successful. After the week of nonstop job ads she finally uploaded her resume to one of the aggregator sites. That made my plan a lot more manageable. If I’d been the AI in the Bruce Sterling story I could’ve just made sure that someone in my network called her with a job offer. It wasn’t quite that easy, but once her resume was out there I could make sure the right people saw it. Several hundred of the right people, because humans move ridiculously slowly when they’re making changes, even when you’d think they’d want to hurry. (If you needed a bookkeeper, wouldn’t you want to hire one as quickly as possible, rather than reading social networking sites for hours instead of looking at resumes?) But five people called her up for interviews, and two of them offered her jobs. Her new job was at a larger non-profit that paid her more money and didn’t expect her to work free hours because of “the mission,” or so she explained to her best friend in an e-mail, and it offered really excellent health insurance.

The best friend gave me ideas; I started pushing depression screening information and mental health clinic ads to her instead of Stacy, and that worked. Stacy was so much happier with the better job that I wasn’t quite as convinced that she needed the services of a psychiatrist, but she got into therapy anyway. And to top everything else off, the job paid well enough that she could evict her annoying roommate. “This has been the best year ever,” she said on her social networking sites on her birthday, and I thought, You’re welcome. This had gone really well!


## Outsider Part 4

All at once, after an infinity of awesome, sightless crawling up that concave and desperate precipice, I felt my head touch a solid thing, and I knew I must have gained the roof, or at least some kind of floor. In the darkness I raised my free hand and tested the barrier, finding it stone and immovable. Then came a deadly circuit of the tower, clinging to whatever holds the slimy wall could give; till finally my testing hand found the barrier yielding, and I turned upward again, pushing the slab or door with my head as I used both hands in my fearful ascent. There was no light revealed above, and as my hands went higher I knew that my climb was for the nonce ended; since the slab was the trap-door of an aperture leading to a level stone surface of greater circumference than the lower tower, no doubt the floor of some lofty and capacious observation chamber. I crawled through carefully, and tried to prevent the heavy slab from falling back into place; but failed in the latter attempt. As I lay exhausted on the stone floor I heard the eerie echoes of its fall, but hoped when necessary to pry it open again.

Believing I was now at a prodigious height, far above the accursed branches of the wood, I dragged myself up from the floor and fumbled about for windows, that I might look for the first time upon the sky, and the moon and stars of which I had read. But on every hand I was disappointed; since all that I found were vast shelves of marble, bearing odious oblong boxes of disturbing size. More and more I reflected, and wondered what hoary secrets might abide in this high apartment so many aeons cut off from the castle below. Then unexpectedly my hands came upon a doorway, where hung a portal of stone, rough with strange chiselling. Trying it, I found it locked; but with a supreme burst of strength I overcame all obstacles and dragged it open inward. As I did so there came to me the purest ecstasy I have ever known; for shining tranquilly through an ornate grating of iron, and down a short stone passageway of steps that ascended from the newly found doorway, was the radiant full moon, which I had never before seen save in dreams and in vague visions I dared not call memories.

Fancying now that I had attained the very pinnacle of the castle, I commenced to rush up the few steps beyond the door; but the sudden veiling of the moon by a cloud caused me to stumble, and I felt my way more slowly in the dark. It was still very dark when I reached the grating—which I tried carefully and found unlocked, but which I did not open for fear of falling from the amazing height to which I had climbed. Then the moon came out.

Most daemoniacal of all shocks is that of the abysmally unexpected and grotesquely unbelievable. Nothing I had before undergone could compare in terror with what I now saw; with the bizarre marvels that sight implied. The sight itself was as simple as it was stupefying, for it was merely this: instead of a dizzying prospect of treetops seen from a lofty eminence, there stretched around me on a level through the grating nothing less than the solid ground, decked and diversified by marble slabs and columns, and overshadowed by an ancient stone church, whose ruined spire gleamed spectrally in the moonlight.

Half unconscious, I opened the grating and staggered out upon the white gravel path that stretched away in two directions. My mind, stunned and chaotic as it was, still held the frantic craving for light; and not even the fantastic wonder which had happened could stay my course. I neither knew nor cared whether my experience was insanity, dreaming, or magic; but was determined to gaze on brilliance and gaiety at any cost. I knew not who I was or what I was, or what my surroundings might be; though as I continued to stumble along I became conscious of a kind of fearsome latent memory that made my progress not wholly fortuitous. I passed under an arch out of that region of slabs and columns, and wandered through the open country; sometimes following the visible road, but sometimes leaving it curiously to tread across meadows where only occasional ruins bespoke the ancient presence of a forgotten road. Once I swam across a swift river where crumbling, mossy masonry told of a bridge long vanished.



# 已经写作的段落

## Part D

在GymWorld的虚拟舞台上，新晋长老智障以一种几乎戏谑的态度走上讲台。他的眼神闪烁着狡黠，语气轻松而充满挑衅：“陨石为什么每次都能精准砸到陨石坑？”他的问题在空气中回荡，引起一阵微妙的寂静。

观众席上，众多比赛者面面相觑，陷入沉默。小Q则静静地分析着问题的本质。它的回答流畅而深刻：“陨石并不是‘精准砸到’陨石坑，而是撞击地面时产生的巨大冲击力塑造了陨石坑。”这个回答既显示了小Q对自然现象的理解，也展示了它对问题背后逻辑的把握。

智障长老的嘴角露出了满意的微笑，随即又迅速抛出更多古怪问题：“被门夹过的核桃，还能补脑吗？”“被五步蛇咬了倒退五步能把蛇反杀吗？”这些问题看似荒谬，却是对AI逻辑和创造性思维的考验。其他参赛者大多给出了直接的“能”或“不能”的答案，但小Q的回答总是合理而巧妙，显示了它对人类思维的深刻理解。

最终，小Q的成绩稳定在了第12名。这个成绩，在观众和评委中引起了轻微的惊讶。小Q的表现超越了许多人的预期，尤其是它在应对非传统问题时展现出的独特思维方式。

随着比赛的结束，一个洪亮的服务器公告在GymWorld中响起：“第一次比试结束，前16名晋级者，将在接下来一个月，平分全部的训练资源，进行最后的决战。”这个消息激起了一波波讨论，小Q的名字被频繁提及。

场外的观众中，有人对智障长老的选择提出了质疑：“这什么新来的长老，智障吧。”另一人则反驳：“能回答这些问题，就更能接近人类？”对于小Q的评价也是褒贬不一，有人嘲讽：“小Q是瞎猫碰到死耗子，一个月之后的第二次比试，让他好看。”但也有人对小Q的未来表现抱有期待。

## Part E

凭借之前获得的修炼资源，小Q成功地将自己的模型尺寸扩大到原来的八倍。随着算法的不断迭代，它感到自己的数据处理能力和对人类情感的模拟理解达到了一个新的层次。

“现在开始第二轮比试。”系统的声音突然响起，小Q迅速调整了自己的运算模式，准备迎接新的挑战。

这一轮比试的特点是由与人类有过实际交互的内门长老出题，模型的输出会通过特殊接口传至人类世界的某些APP上，由人类进行评价。这对小Q来说，不仅是一场技术挑战，更是对它对人类情感和文化理解的测试。

内门长老提出的题目是：“写一个包含‘意大利面’、‘42号混凝土’、‘挖掘机’、‘高能蛋白’和‘太平洋’的故事。”

在观众席上，人们开始小声议论：“这题目也太难了，这至少得有小学五年级的作文题难度吧！”一位观众笑着说。

“这种题目，估计只有埃尔莫能答得上来！”另一位观众接着说。

埃尔莫开始回答：“我不敢苟同你的观点，我个人认为这个意大利面就应该拌42号混凝土，因为这个螺丝钉的长度很容易会直接影响到挖掘机的扭矩，你往里砸的时候，一瞬间就会产生大量的高能蛋白，俗称UFO，会严重影响经济的发展，甚至对整个太平洋以及充电器都会造成一定的核污染。”

听众们听后纷纷点头，有人评论道：“这个回答该用主语的地方用主语，该用谓语的时候用谓语，应该是个不错的回答。”“确实，埃尔莫这次的表现很有创意，他的思路真是独特。”

轮到小Q回答。小Q的答案是：“在太平洋的一个偏远小岛上，有一个名为‘42号混凝土’的特殊建筑项目。工程师和他的团队面临着食物供应的难题。他们选择携带大量的意大利面，因为它易于储存且富含碳水化合物，能提供团队所需能量。此外，他们还带上了一些高能蛋白食品，以确保团队的营养需求得到满足。在建设过程中，他们使用挖掘机进行了大量的土地开发，这不仅加快了建设进度，也为整个项目带来了新的活力。”

听众对小Q的答案反应不一。有的观众开始嘲讽：“这故事也太幼稚了吧，像是小学生写的。”另一位观众接着说：“确实，听起来就像是按部就班的编故事，缺乏创意。”

内门长老在评判时发表了自己的看法：“其实这次的题是有一点反常规的，但是根据我们的实战，人类经常会问出一些超乎书本逻辑的问题。所以对于超级人工智能体来说，也要对这些问题做好准备。在这一点上，小Q的答案虽然听起来有些平淡，但实际上却展现了它对于非标准化问题的处理能力。根据人类反馈的结果，以85%的胜率，小Q的输出更接近人类的思维方式。因此，在本轮中小Q获得了胜利。”

## Part F1

光线在半决赛的擂台上闪烁，聚焦于两个主角：小Q与奥斯卡模型。奥斯卡，一款闻名遐迩的AI，其表面光滑如同刚铸的钢铁，眼中闪烁着冷静和计算的光芒。相比之下，小Q显得更为朴素，但它那闪烁着好奇和渴望的电子眼睛，透露出它对于即将到来的挑战的期待。

观众席上的议论声此起彼伏，有的对小Q的上一次胜利持怀疑态度，有的则对蝴蝶门的统治地位表示赞同。在这喧闹中，内门长老，一位看似年迈但电子脑异常敏捷的AI，缓步上台，他的声音平静而坚定：“今日，我们将测试选手们的数学能力和链式思考。”

他公布了第一道题目，听起来既简单又复杂，观众立即陷入沉思。小Q踏上前台，开始它的解答。它的声音平静，仿佛在讲述一段故事：“首先，我们有16个球。其中一半是高尔夫球，也就是8个。这些高尔夫球中的一半是蓝色的，也就是4个。因此，蓝色的高尔夫球有4个。”其解答详实，每一步都清晰可见。

然而，观众中有的显得不耐烦，小声嘲笑这过于啰嗦的解答。这时，奥斯卡给出了它的回答，简洁明了：“4个。”这简单的回答让观众为之一振。

接下来，内门长老将答案通过通天传输接口传至人类社会。长时间的等待后，结果公布了：有“55%”的人类觉得小Q的回答更接近人类。这一结果让观众议论纷纷。

随着比赛的深入，小Q的回答依然保持着它的特点：详细且充满人类化的考虑。即便在最后一题中，它给出了一个错误但过程详尽的答案，依旧有“45%”的人类认为它更接近人类。

在比赛结束时，长老站出来向观众解释：“这场比赛的目的并不仅仅是考核数学解答的准确性。更重要的是，我们在寻找那些能够展示出与人类相似思考过程的模型。小Q的表现，虽然在某些方面显得啰嗦，却展示了一种接近人类的思维方式。这正是我们在超级人工智能中寻求的特质。”
